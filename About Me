Hi, I'm Bianca!

  I'm a second year engineering student in UST. Im 19 years old, born on the 4th of June, year 2000. Everyday, I commute at least 2 hours from Cainta, Rizal to UST because I wasn't allowed to live in dormitories. I have two siblings whom I love very much; one girl and a boy. I'm the eldest, that's why I try to become a good example to them.
  
  To be honest, I was never good at math. When I was younger, I asked my mom what course doesn't have a math subject because I didn't want to study it anymore. I was in 12th grade when I decided to study Electronics Engineering, it wasn't really my choice but i believe it's where God wanted me to be.
  
  In 2020, I will be Engr. Bianca Rey.
